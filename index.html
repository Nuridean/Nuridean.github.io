  <h3 id="Intro">Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Cho'gath, also known as the Terror of the Void is a champion in the game League of Legends. Released by Riot Games in 2009, he is classiifed as a Tank and a Mage.</p>

<p>     His kit revolves around dominating laning phase by shutting down opponent with crowd-control abilities.
  </p>
<p>  In addition to his crowd control, his passive helps him out sustain the opposing laner.</p>
  <p> My favorite reason for using him is that he is one the few champions in the game that can dish out a ton of damage while being very bulky and hard to kill. </p>

<h3 id="Spells"> Abilities</h3>
<p> His passive, Carnivore gives Cho'Gath health and mana for each enemy killed(health and mana restored scales with level.) As stated before his passive helps him not just sustain in lane but out sustain the oppenent, allowing for early trades without having to back before the enemy if played correctly.</p>
  <P> His Q, Rupture, is a AOE knock-up which slows opponents for 60% for 1.5 seconds. Rupture can be used to engage or disengage (such as ganks) the enemy and can also be used to stop the other laner from last hitting as the knock up messes with their last hitting.
